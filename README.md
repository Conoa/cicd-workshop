## What is this?
This repo contains setup scripts for Conoa CICD workshop. <br>

## Terraform
Terraform reads all .tf files in a directory.

Add your access and secret key to credentials.tf

 cat << EOT > credentials.tf
  provider "aws" {
  access_key = "YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  secret_key = "YOUR SECRET KEY"
  region = "eu-central-1"
 }
 EOT
```
If the AMI isn't found, search after a new one: 
```
aws --region eu-central-1 ec2 describe-images --owners aws-marketplace --filters Name=product-code,Values=aw0evgkw8e5c1q413zgy5pjce
```

To setup our instances, just run:
```
terraform apply
```
